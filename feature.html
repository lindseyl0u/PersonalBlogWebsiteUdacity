                <h2>Meet the Leaf Sheep: The Adorable Ocean Slug with a Green Thumb</h2>
                <p>If you’ve ever wondered what a sea creature would look like if it were part plant, meet the leaf sheep — one of the ocean’s most adorable and fascinating creatures. Officially known as <em>Elysia chlorotica</em>, the leaf sheep slug is a type of sacoglossan sea slug that looks like a tiny, cute, green sheep grazing on the ocean floor. But don’t let its cuddly appearance fool you—this little creature has some impressive skills that make it a true marvel of nature.</p>
                <h3>What Exactly Is a Leaf Sheep?</h3>
                <p>The leaf sheep is a type of <em>sacoglossan</em> sea slug, a family of slugs known for their unique feeding habits and remarkable ability to absorb chloroplasts from the algae they eat. The leaf sheep, however, takes this to the next level. It’s one of the few creatures on Earth capable of a process called <strong>photosynthesis</strong>—the ability to produce its own energy from sunlight, just like plants.</p>
                <p>This is made possible by a phenomenon called <strong>kleptoplasty</strong>, where the slug steals the chloroplasts from the algae it consumes and stores them in its own cells. Over time, it can continue to "photosynthesize" even after it has stopped eating algae. This makes the leaf sheep somewhat of an oceanic superhero: a slug that can live off sunlight!</p>
                <h3>Why Do They Look Like Little Sheep?</h3>
                <p>While the leaf sheep might remind you of a tiny, green, oceanic sheep with leafy ears, its “fluff” isn’t wool. Those fluffy appendages on its back are actually <strong>cerata</strong> (the scientific term for the projections on a slug’s body), which are covered in algae and assist in the slug's photosynthetic abilities.</p>
                <p>The leaf sheep’s vibrant green color comes from the algae it consumes, specifically species like <em>Vaucheria litorea</em>, which gives it the perfect leafy camouflage to blend in with its surroundings in the shallow coastal waters of the eastern United States. The more algae it consumes, the greener it gets. Essentially, this little creature is a walking, grazing garden in the sea!</p>
